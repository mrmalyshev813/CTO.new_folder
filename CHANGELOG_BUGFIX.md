# Changelog: Bugfix - Unknown Error & Pre-Submit Checks

## Date: 2024-10-29

### Summary

This update addresses the "Unknown error" issue in error handling and adds comprehensive pre-commit validation checks to ensure code quality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed "Unknown Error" Issue in Frontend (index.html)

**Problem**: When the server returned a non-JSON response or an error occurred during parsing, the frontend would show a generic "Unknown error" message without details.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in the `handleSearch()` function:

- Added detailed response logging (status, headers, content-type)
- Improved error response parsing with multiple fallback strategies
- Added specific error messages for different error types:
  - Network errors (fetch failures)
  - Type errors (invalid URLs)
  - Timeout errors
  - Non-JSON responses from server
- Added raw response text logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html` (lines 276-365)

**Impact**: Users now see more descriptive error messages, and developers can debug issues more easily with comprehensive console logging.

### 2. Added Pre-Commit and Pre-Push Hooks

**Problem**: No automated checks existed to validate code before commits, leading to potential syntax errors and code quality issues.

**Solution**: Implemented Git hooks using Husky and lint-staged:

**New Tools**:
- `husky` (v9.1.7) - Git hooks manager
- `lint-staged` (v16.2.6) - Run linters on staged files

**New Scripts** (package.json):
- `lint` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `lint:check` - Run ESLint without fixing
- `validate:js` - Check JavaScript syntax
- `validate:html` - Validate HTML structure
- `precommit` - Run all validation checks
- `prepare` - Install Husky hooks

**Git Hooks Created**:
1. `.husky/pre-commit` - Runs before each commit:
   - JavaScript syntax validation
   - HTML structure validation
   - ESLint checks
   - Lint-staged for staged files

2. `.husky/pre-push` - Runs before each push:
   - JavaScript syntax validation
   - HTML structure validation
   - ESLint checks

**Files Created**:
- `.husky/pre-commit`
- `.husky/pre-push`
- `PRE_COMMIT_CHECKS.md` - Documentation

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Added scripts and lint-staged configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - Updated rules to allow `require()` in serverless functions

### 3. Fixed ESLint Warnings

**Problem**: ESLint was reporting warnings for unused variables and CommonJS imports.

**Solution**:
- Updated `.eslintrc.json` to allow `require()` imports in serverless functions
- Removed unused catch parameters (replaced with empty catch blocks)
- Prefixed intentionally unused parameters with underscore
- Fixed unused variable warnings in all function files

**Files Modified**:
- `netlify/functions/analyze.js`
- `netlify/functions/export-docx.js`
- `netlify/functions/export-pdf.js`
- `.eslintrc.json`

## Testing Performed

All validation scripts were tested and pass successfully:

```bash
✅ npm run validate:js
✅ npm run validate:html
✅ npm run lint:check
✅ npm run precommit
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Clear, descriptive error messages instead of "Unknown error"
2. **Code Quality**: Automated checks prevent syntax errors and style issues
3. **Developer Experience**: Hooks catch issues early, before code review
4. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify and fix issues faster
5. **Consistency**: Enforced code style across the project

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible.

## Migration Guide

After pulling these changes:

```bash
# Install new dependencies
npm install

# Hooks will be automatically installed via the prepare script
# Test that hooks are working
npm run precommit
```

## Documentation

- `PRE_COMMIT_CHECKS.md` - Guide for using pre-commit hooks
- `README.md` - Updated with pre-commit information (if needed)

## Known Issues

- ESLint warning about missing pages directory (can be ignored, it's from Next.js config)

## Future Improvements

- Add automated tests that run in pre-push hook
- Add commit message validation
- Add file size checks for large files
- Add check for sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
