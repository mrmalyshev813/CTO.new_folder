# Setup Instructions for OpenAI API Key

## Important: GitHub Push Protection

GitHub detected the hardcoded OpenAI API key and blocked the push for security reasons. This is actually a **good thing** as it protects your API key from being exposed publicly.

## Solution: Use Environment Variables

The code has been updated to use environment variables instead. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create `.env.local` file

In the root of your project, create a file named `.env.local`:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

Add the following line to `.env.local`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_from_ticket
```

**Important**: Replace `your_openai_api_key_from_ticket` with the actual OpenAI API key provided in the ticket.

### 3. Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`

The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed to Git. This keeps your API key safe.

### 4. Restart Development Server

After adding the `.env.local` file, restart your development server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again
npm run dev
```

## Why This Approach is Better

✅ **Security**: API key is not exposed in public repository  
✅ **Flexibility**: Different keys for dev/staging/production  
✅ **Best Practice**: Standard approach for sensitive data  
✅ **Team Friendly**: Each developer can use their own key  

## Testing

After setting up your `.env.local` file, run the tests:

```bash
# Static tests
node test-spline-interface.js

# Runtime tests (with dev server running)
npm run dev &
sleep 10
node test-runtime.js
```

## Alternative: For Local Testing Only

If you absolutely need to hardcode the key for local testing (NOT recommended for production):

1. Add it to a local configuration file that's not tracked by Git
2. Use a separate `.env.development.local` file
3. Never commit files containing the API key

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your hosting platform:
   - **Vercel**: Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - **Netlify**: Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - **Heroku**: Config Vars
   - **AWS/Azure**: Environment configuration

2. The app will automatically use the environment variable

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "OpenAI API key is not configured"

**Cause**: The `.env.local` file is missing or the key is not set.

**Solution**:
1. Create `.env.local` in the project root
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Restart the dev server

### API Key Not Working

**Cause**: Key might be expired or invalid.

**Solution**:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update `.env.local` with the new key
4. Restart the server

## Summary

The implementation is complete and working. The only change needed is:

1. Create `.env.local` file
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Restart the server

Everything else works exactly as specified in the original requirements!

**Note**: This approach is required by GitHub's security policies and is the industry standard for handling API keys and sensitive credentials.
