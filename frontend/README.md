# Frontend Workspace

This directory will contain the frontend application. The exact stack is yet to be defined. A typical setup might leverage a modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte with Vite.

## Getting Started (Future Guidance)

Once the frontend stack is chosen, expect commands along the lines of:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Configuration and detailed instructions will be added alongside the initial frontend implementation.
