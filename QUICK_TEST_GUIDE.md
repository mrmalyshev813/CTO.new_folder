## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue: "Ошибка сети"
**Meaning**: Can't connect to server
**Fix**: Check internet connection, reload page

### Issue: "OpenAI API key is not configured"
**Meaning**: Environment variable not set
**Fix**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Netlify environment variables

### Issue: "Превышено время ожидания"
**Meaning**: Request took > 30 seconds
**Fix**: This is expected for very slow sites. Fallback should handle it.

### Issue: Button doesn't appear
**Meaning**: JavaScript error or old cache
**Fix**: Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
