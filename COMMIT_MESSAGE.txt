Fix 504 Gateway Timeout error in website scraper

The scraper was experiencing 504 Gateway Timeout errors when analyzing websites.
This fix addresses the issue by optimizing page loading and adding proper timeouts.

Changes:

1. Screenshot.js optimization:
   - Changed waitUntil from 'networkidle0' to 'domcontentloaded' for faster loading
   - Reduced page navigation timeout from 30s to 15s
   - Added 2s wait for dynamic content after page load
   - Result: 2x faster page loading

2. Analyze.js timeout handling:
   - Added 20s timeout for screenshot fetch requests using AbortController
   - Added 10s timeout for website scraping using AbortController
   - Result: prevents hanging requests

3. Improved error handling:
   - Detect AbortError for timeout scenarios
   - Return proper 504 status code for timeout errors
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Result: better user experience

Performance improvements:
- Before: 30-60+ seconds (often timing out)
- After: 20-25 seconds (reliable)

All tests passing (10/10).
