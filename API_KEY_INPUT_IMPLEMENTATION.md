# API Key Input Implementation

## Summary

Added a simple, user-friendly API key input field to the NLABTEAM Smart Parser application, allowing users to provide their own OpenAI API key for analyzing websites.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure
- Added password input field (`#apiKeyInput`) above the search input
- Removed the old API key button
- Simplified description text to "Покажи роботу что искать и он все найдет..."

### 2. CSS Styling
- Added custom styling for `#apiKeyInput`:
  - Dark theme matching existing design
  - Monospace font for better key visibility
  - Blue border on focus (#0066ff)
  - Green border for valid input (#00cc66)
  - Password type for security

### 3. JavaScript Functionality

#### API Key Management
- **`initApiKey()`**: Loads saved API key from localStorage on page load
- **`saveApiKey()`**: Saves API key to localStorage when field loses focus
- **`getApiKey()`**: Retrieves API key from input field or localStorage

#### Website Analysis
- **`analyzeWebsite(url)`**: Makes direct calls to OpenAI API
  - Validates API key (must start with "sk-")
  - Uses thum.io for website screenshots
  - Calls OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model
  - Returns JSON with advertising zones

#### UI Updates
- **`displayResults(result)`**: Shows analysis results in clean format
- **`handleSearch()`**: Main handler with validation and error handling

### 4. Validation & Error Handling
- ✅ API key must start with "sk-"
- ✅ Focus on API key field if missing
- ✅ Clear error messages in Russian
- ✅ Proper error handling for API failures

## Testing Checklist

- [x] API key saves to localStorage on blur
- [x] API key loads from localStorage on page refresh
- [x] Validation rejects keys not starting with "sk-"
- [x] Error shown when API key is missing
- [x] Focus moves to API key field when missing
- [x] Direct OpenAI API calls work with user's key
- [x] Invalid API key shows "Неверный API ключ" error
- [x] Results display correctly after successful analysis

## User Experience

1. **First Visit**: User enters their OpenAI API key in the password field
2. **Auto-Save**: Key is saved to localStorage when field loses focus
3. **Persistence**: Key is automatically loaded on future visits
4. **Usage**: User enters website URL and clicks "Найти" to analyze
5. **Analysis**: System makes direct call to OpenAI API using user's key

## Security Notes

- API key stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- Input field type="password" hides key from view
- No server-side storage of user's API key
- User has full control over their API key

## Architecture Change

**Before**: Frontend → Netlify Function → OpenAI API  
**After**: Frontend → OpenAI API (direct)

This simplifies the architecture and eliminates the need for server-side API key configuration.
