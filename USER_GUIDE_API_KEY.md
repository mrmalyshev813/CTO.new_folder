## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where is my API key stored?

Your API key is stored securely in your browser's localStorage. It never leaves your browser except when making API calls to OpenAI.

### Is my API key safe?

- Your key is stored only on your device (in browser localStorage)
- The application doesn't send your key to any server except OpenAI
- The input field is masked (password type) so others can't see it
- **Recommendation**: Always use HTTPS and never share your API key with others

### How much does it cost?

The application uses OpenAI's API, which is a paid service. Costs depend on your usage:
- GPT-4o for vision analysis: ~$5-10 per 1M tokens
- GPT-4o-mini for text generation: ~$0.15-0.60 per 1M tokens

Each website analysis uses approximately:
- 1,000-2,000 tokens for vision analysis
- 500-1,500 tokens for text generation
- **Estimated cost**: $0.01-0.05 per website analysis

You can monitor your usage and set spending limits in your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

### Can I change my API key later?

Yes! Just click the API key button (bottom-right corner) and enter a new key.

### What if I lose my API key?

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Revoke the old key (for security)
3. Create a new key
4. Update it in the application

### Do I need to configure the key every time?

No! Your API key is saved in your browser and persists across sessions. You only need to configure it once per browser/device.

### The application says my key is invalid

Make sure your API key:
- Starts with `sk-`
- Was copied completely (no spaces or missing characters)
- Hasn't been revoked in your OpenAI account
- Has sufficient credits in your OpenAI account

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "API –∫–ª—é—á –Ω–µ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω"

### Error: "The OPENAI_API_KEY is missing"

**Solution**: Same as above - configure your API key in the settings.

### Error: "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid API key"

**Possible causes**:
1. Your API key is incorrect

**Solution**: 
1. Check your key in [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Verify your account has credits
3. Create a new key if needed

### Error: "429 Too Many Requests"

**Cause**: You've exceeded your rate limit or quota.

**Solution**:
