# Fix Summary: Site Parsing and Screenshots

## Problem
The application was not parsing websites or taking screenshots. Instead, it was directly calling the OpenAI API from the frontend, which resulted in generic responses like "Unfortunately, I cannot directly browse or analyze websites" because the AI has no web browsing capabilities.

## Root Cause
The frontend (`index.html`) was bypassing the backend Netlify function that handles:
- Website crawling with Puppeteer
- Screenshot capture
- HTML parsing
- AI analysis with actual website content

Instead, it was making a direct API call to OpenAI with just a simple text prompt asking it to analyze a website URL.

## Solution
Updated `/index.html` to:

1. **Call the backend function**: Changed from calling `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` directly to calling `/.netlify/functions/analyze`
2. **Removed client-side API key management**: Since the backend handles authentication via environment variables
3. **Enhanced result display**: Now properly displays:
   - Found advertising zones with color-coded priorities
   - Complete advertising proposal in Russian
4. **Better error handling**: Displays specific error messages from the backend

## How It Works Now

1. User enters a website URL
2. Frontend sends URL to `/.netlify/functions/analyze`
3. Backend function:
   - Launches Puppeteer/Chromium
   - Navigates to the website
   - Takes a full-page screenshot
   - Extracts HTML content
   - Sends HTML snippet to OpenAI for analysis
   - Generates a Russian-language advertising proposal
4. Results are displayed in the UI with zones and proposal

## Files Modified
- `/index.html` - Fixed frontend to use backend API correctly

## Configuration Required
Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Netlify environment variables for the backend function to work.

## Testing
To test locally with Netlify CLI:
```bash
netlify dev
```

Then open the application and enter a website URL to analyze.
