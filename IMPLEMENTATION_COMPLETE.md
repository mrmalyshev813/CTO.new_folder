## ⚠️ Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: The OpenAI API key is hardcoded in the application as per project requirements.

**Location**: `/app/api/search/route.ts` (Line 17)

**Risks**:
- ❌ Key is visible in client-side code
- ❌ Can be extracted and potentially abused
- ❌ No rate limiting on client requests
- ❌ Not suitable for production use

**Recommended Production Setup**:
1. Move API key to environment variables
2. Use server-side API route (already implemented)
3. Add authentication/authorization
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Monitor API usage
6. Use API key rotation
