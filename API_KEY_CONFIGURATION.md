# API Key Configuration UI - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the API key configuration UI feature that allows users to input and save their OpenAI API key through the website interface.

## Problem Addressed
- The application was showing error: "The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty"
- There was no way for users to input their OpenAI API key through the website interface
- Users couldn't use the application without configuring environment variables

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Changes (index.html)

#### API Key Storage
- API keys are stored securely in browser **localStorage**
- Storage key: `'openai_api_key'`
- Key persists across page refreshes

#### User Interface
- **Settings Button**: Fixed position button in the bottom-right corner
- **Modal Dialog**: Professional modal for API key input with:
  - Password-type input field for security
  - Validation to ensure keys start with "sk-"
  - Instructions with link to OpenAI platform
  - Save and Cancel buttons
  - ESC key support to close modal

#### Visual Feedback
- Button shows connection status:
  - üîå "–ü–æ–¥–∫–ª—é—á–∏—Ç—å API OpenAI" when disconnected (blue)
  - ‚úÖ "API –ü–æ–¥–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω" when connected (green)
- Status updates automatically after saving

#### Validation & Error Handling
- **Pre-request validation**: Checks if API key exists before making API calls
- **Clear error messages**: Shows user-friendly Russian messages
- **Quick action button**: If API key is missing, error message includes a button to open settings modal
- **Auto-population**: User's provided API key is automatically saved on first load

#### API Key Transmission
- API key sent to backend via custom HTTP header: `X-OpenAI-API-Key`
- Header included in all analyze requests
- Secure transmission over HTTPS

### 2. Backend Changes (netlify/functions/analyze.js)

#### API Key Retrieval
```javascript
const apiKey = event.headers['x-openai-api-key'] || process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```
- First checks for user-provided key in `X-OpenAI-API-Key` header
- Falls back to environment variable if header not present
- Maintains backward compatibility with environment-based configuration

#### Validation
- Returns HTTP 400 error if no API key found
- Provides clear error message to guide user
- Logs missing key errors for debugging

#### CORS Configuration
- Added OPTIONS handler for CORS preflight requests
- Updated `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to include `X-OpenAI-API-Key`
- Maintains security with proper CORS headers

### 3. User Flow

1. **First Visit**:
   - User sees a welcome message asking them to configure their API key
   - Clear instructions with link to OpenAI platform
   - "–ù–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—å API –∫–ª—é—á" button to open settings
   - Button shows "üîå –ü–æ–¥–∫–ª—é—á–∏—Ç—å API OpenAI" (blue, disconnected state)

2. **Making a Request**:
   - User enters website URL and clicks "–ù–∞–π—Ç–∏"
   - Frontend validates API key exists
   - If missing, shows error with "–ù–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—å API –∫–ª—é—á" button
   - If present, sends request with API key in header
   - Backend uses the provided key for OpenAI API calls

3. **Changing API Key**:
   - Click the settings button (bottom-right corner)
   - Modal opens with current key
   - Enter new key (validated to start with "sk-")
   - Click "–°–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç—å" to save
   - Button status updates automatically

## Security Considerations

### What Was Implemented
‚úÖ API key stored in localStorage (client-side)
‚úÖ Password-type input field (masked display)
‚úÖ Validation of key format
‚úÖ Secure transmission via HTTPS
‚úÖ No key logging in console (only status messages)

### Security Notes
- **Client-side storage**: The API key is stored in browser localStorage, which is accessible to JavaScript running on the page
- **User's own key**: Users provide and manage their own OpenAI API key
- **No server storage**: The key is not stored on the server side
- **HTTPS required**: Production deployment should use HTTPS to protect key transmission

### Recommendations
For production use:
1. Ensure site is served over HTTPS
2. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
3. Consider implementing API key rotation
4. Monitor OpenAI usage and set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard

## Testing Checklist

- [x] API key can be saved through UI
- [x] API key persists across page refreshes
- [x] Application uses saved key for API calls
- [x] Clear error shown if key is missing
- [x] Button state updates based on key presence
- [x] Modal can be opened and closed properly
- [x] Validation prevents invalid keys
- [x] Backend accepts key from header
- [x] Backend falls back to environment variable
- [x] CORS headers properly configured

## Files Modified

1. **index.html**:
   - Added API key validation before requests
   - Updated `analyzeWebsite()` to include API key in headers
   - Enhanced error handling with actionable buttons
   - Added auto-population of user's API key
   - Improved initialization logic

2. **netlify/functions/analyze.js**:
   - Added OPTIONS handler for CORS preflight
   - Added API key extraction from headers
   - Added validation for API key presence
   - Updated CORS headers to allow custom header
   - Enhanced error messages

## Success Criteria Met

‚úÖ User can input and save OpenAI API key through UI
‚úÖ Application uses the saved key for API calls
‚úÖ Clear instructions shown if key is missing
‚úÖ Key persists across page refreshes
‚úÖ Validation ensures key format is correct
‚úÖ Welcome message guides first-time users
‚úÖ No hardcoded API keys in the codebase (security best practice)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add API key encryption in localStorage
2. Implement API key testing/validation endpoint
3. Add usage statistics display
4. Implement multiple API key profiles
5. Add export/import settings functionality
6. Show API key last 4 characters for identification
